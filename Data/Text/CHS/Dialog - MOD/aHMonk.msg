{100}{}{你看见阿比的修士首领。}
{101}{}{出于某种原因使得你相信这个修士是个重要的人物。}

{200}{}{欢迎你旅行者。}
{201}{}{愿你平安。}
{202}{}{我们是知识的守护者。}
{203}{}{我很抱歉，我们的书没能帮到你。}

{3000}{}{我能帮你什么?}
{300}{}{欢迎来到阿比，旅行者。我能帮你吗？}
{301}{}{能和我说说你们现在的情况吗？}
{302}{}{你听说过伊甸园创造器吗？}
{303}{}{你知道哪能找到13号避难所吗？}
{304}{}{再见。}

{400}{}{你想知道什么？}
{401}{}{好的。我还知道些别的。}
{402}{}{嗯....好像有点印象。是的，我想起来了。托马斯修士最近研究过。}
{403}{}{你有？太好了！我能见他吗？}
{404}{}{对些我什么都不知道。}
{405}{}{好吧，总之谢谢你。}
{406}{}{我想恐怕托马斯修士是知道这个信息最后的人。虽然我们的电脑也许会有备份。}
{407}{}{他死了吗？出什么事？}
{408}{}{生活在我们的地下洞穴里的某种强大的怪物杀了他，最少我想是这样的。他下去有几天了，我们很害怕下去那找他。 }

{4091}{}{So no one else has even bothered to go down there and check on him? What if he's simply trapped down there somehow, and he's slowly starving to death?}
{4092}{}{I suppose that's possible, but you must understand. We are a peaceful people. The thought of going up against one of those wasteland monsters is terrifying to us. We're simply not equipped for such confrontations. }

{409}{}{Hmmm. Maybe I should take a look what's down there. *I AM* the chosen one after all...}
{410}{}{我喜欢冒险，我能下去看看。}
{1411}{}{非~非常有趣。我得走了。}

{411}{}{你确定要那样做？托马斯修士身上带了一本很重要的书，那是我们的创始人传下来的书，我很希望能拿回来。如果你拿到我就允许你使用我们的电脑查阅你需要的资料。}
{412}{}{成交。我马上就回来。}
{413}{}{也话让我再考虑一下...}
{414}{}{太好了，你找到书就告诉我。}
{415}{}{好的，再见。}

{416}{}{又见面了，我的朋友。}
{417}{}{我杀了那个怪物，书也拿到了！}
{4177}{}{我杀了那个怪物！}
{418}{}{太好了！给我！}
{4188}{}{太好了！那本书怎么样了；你找到了吗？}
{419}{}{拿去。}
{420}{}{别急，这东西对你来说值多少钱？}

{421}{}{(他接过书) 你为我们做了件好事。你现在可以自由使用图书馆里的电脑了。告诉保罗你获准使用我们的挡案了。}
{422}{}{谢谢。}

{423}{}{你要用钱换这个？好吧。这是$250。去找保罗谈使用电脑的事吧。}
{424}{}{谢谢你的钱。再见。}

{425}{}{你应该去楼下看看，现在你可以自由使用那的电脑了。}
{426}{}{好的，再见。}

{430}{}{What is the purpose of your order?}
{431}{}{What is the history behind the Abbey?}
{432}{}{Hmm, I don't have any questions at the moment.}
{433}{}{Our holy mission is to read, copy and take care of our sacred books of knowledge and other relics of the lost age. It is our hope that with this knowledge we are able to create a Memorabilia that might one day help humanity emerge from its self-imposed Dark Age. Any information that we come across is recorded, lest it be lost like so much was in the great Flame Deluge.}
{434}{}{After the Great War, the guiding hands of fate directed our ancestors to this old Abbey in the mountains. Due to its remote location, the monastery survived the Flame Deluge mostly unscathed. As our ancestors explored the building, they discovered an extensive library of books. And not just religious texts, oh no, this library contained the gamut of written works, from literary classics, to scientific encyclopedias.}
{435}{}{What happened then?}
{436}{}{I've heard enough.}
{437}{}{They soon realized the true treasure trove of wisdom stored within those books―specially the scientific tomes. Here were the chronicles of a fallen civilization. A lost age. There were a few who thought it might be best to destroy this knowledge, for fear that it would once again guide humanity towards apocalypse. But it was eventually decided that they would instead dedicate themselves to ensuring the preservation of the books, to be released when, and if, the world was ready for it.}
{438}{}{(More)}
{439}{}{And so, utilizing a small printing press, they began making copies of the books, and also transcribing them into the Abbey's computers to preserve them digitally, should the physical books ever be destroyed. Over the long years, others have come across the Abbey, and some have elected to stay and live out their lives in the tranquil quiet of our mountain home.}
{440}{}{Thanks for the story.}
{441}{}{Where did your ancestors come from?}
{442}{}{They never told where they originally came from. We suspect that they came here originally from the east.}
{443}{}{Well, thanks for the story.}
{444}{}{Do you need any help here at the monastery?}
{445}{}{I found out what's wrong with your water pump.}
{446}{}{Do you know anything about the original founders?}
{447}{}{I do not know all the names of our founders, but the most important one I am aware of is Miller. Before the Great War he was an electrical engineer working for the United States government. Shortly thereafter, he converted to Catholicism and made an oath with himself that we would spend the rest of his life preserving the knowledge of the past. His greatest fear was that this knowledge would be lost forever and thus needed to be preserved so that future generations may benefit.}
{448}{}{You must be quite knowledgeable having read so much.}
{449}{}{I have indeed read much in my life. Yet you might be disappointed at the limitations of my knowledge. You see, we record and preserve. We are forbidden to act upon the wisdom of these books, therefore our understanding of the text is quite limited.}
{450}{}{Wait, you're telling me that you just blindly transcribe these books without even trying to comprehend them?}
{451}{}{As I've said, it is our job to preserve this knowledge, not to understand it. Before this knowledge can be returned to mankind, he must first prove to have risen above his tendency of mass genocide. That's the only way to ensure that history does not repeat itself.}
{452}{}{Well, I've got news for you: that day's never going to come. And while you're hoarding all this knowledge in your little mountain paradise here, people out in the wasteland are struggling every day to survive. In fact, my entire tribe is on the brink of destruction. The knowledge contained in these books could help cure diseases, improve crops, and greatly increase the chance of humanity's survival.}

{453}{}{Ah, well I suppose you make a good point. But it just seems like the information stored here could help out a lot of people. Even if you don't think the world's ready for this knowledge, I don't see why *you* can't at least try to learn from it. Otherwise, what's the point of keeping it?}
{454}{}{I understand your frustration with our ways, but you must understand that this is the way things have always been for us. To alter things now, after so many years...that would be blasphemous against our faith. No, I feel we must continue to live by the rules set by our ancestors.}

{455}{}{I understand your frustration with our ways, but you must understand that this is the way things have always been for us. To alter things now, after so many years...that would be blasphemous against our faith. Still, I shall consider your words. I sense great wisdom in you, wanderer. It is a pity I have met very few like you.}
{456}{}{Thanks. I'd like to know something else though.}
{457}{}{Very well. I'd like to know something else though.}

{500}{}{Stop that!}
{501}{}{You gain 200 experience points for bringing back the book.}

{600}{}{I fixed your broken waterpump.}
{601}{}{That is great news, indeed. That waterpump had been acting up for quite some time. Those merchants said they could take care of it, but they didn't seem to be making much progress. It's a good thing you came along. Thank you again.}
{602}{}{I expect some money for this you know. Now cough it up!}
{6020}{}{If you truly want to show your gratitude, how about some money for my trouble?}    #new in RP 1.3
{603}{}{No problem. I have some other questions though.}
{604}{}{I'm glad to be of assistance. Take care.}

{605}{}{[Frowns.] I see. Fine, here, take these coins. Now go, and stop bothering me.}
{606}{}{Thank you, *father*.}

{700}{}{Uhh...no I seem to have misplaced it.}
{701}{}{What!? [He sighs deeply.] It is most unfortunate that you were unable to recover that book. But you say you've killed the beast? Hm, then it should be safe to send our own people down to continue searching for it. Anyway, for your service, I shall grant you access to our computers. Go see Brother Paul for the access key.}
{702}{}{Thank you.}

{800}{}{Actually, yes. Our main water pump has been acting up for some time, and now it finally seems to have broken down completely. If you know anything about machinery, do you think you could take a look and see if something could be done? There are a few merchants already working on it. I fear that little progress has been made though.}
{801}{}{I'm happy to help. I'll report back on the progress.}
{802}{}{Sure, I'll be glad to help...for a price of course.}
{803}{}{Actually on second thought, let me ask you something else.}
{804}{}{What!? Oh, fine. If that's the kind of person you are, then you shall receive payment for your service. Here's 25 coins to begin with.  Please let me know if something can be done. [The man sighs as he hands you the coins]}
{805}{}{Hey, no need for the sighing. You think everything in life comes for free? Now, let me get to work.}

{806}{}{Really? Please, do tell.}
{807}{}{The motor gave out and fried all the connectors. I'm going to Vault City to get a new part.}
{808}{}{Oh thank you. You are indeed a great help. Please report back once you install the new part.}
{809}{}{I will. Be back soon.}

{900}{}{You explain to the Abbot that while the information they hold could lead to mankind's annihilation, it could also lead to mankind's salvation.}
{901}{}{You learn about the original founder of the Abbey.}

{1010}{}{Really? That's great. That is very brave of you. You're a big boy.}
{1011}{}{Really? That's great. That is very brave of you. You're a big girl.}
{1012}{}{(smile) I know.}

{1020}{}{Did you happen to find a book lying there? A friend of mine had it, and he went missing.}
{1021}{}{I find book. Here, it heavy and no pitchers inside.}
{1022}{}{I no find book. Sorree. I go look now.}

{1030}{}{I find book.}
{1031}{}{That's great. Thanks. You're one special guy.}
{1032}{}{That's great. Thanks. You're one special gal.}
{1033}{}{YAY.}

#additional dialogue for killing the beast and not having the quest yet
{1100}{}{I was down there earlier. I saw a few dead bodies, so I'm guessing one of them belonged to your missing monk. If it makes you feel any better, I killed the thing responsible for his death.}

{1110}{}{Ah...so it's as I feared. Brother Thomas shall be dearly missed. You have my thanks for ridding us of whatever wasteland beasts lurked down there. However, I... I don't suppose you found a book while you were down there. It's a very important book that was last known to be in Brother Thomas's possession.}
{1111}{}{No, but I suppose I could go back and check.}
{1112}{}{Do you mean this book?}
{1113}{}{Before I go, let me ask you something else.}
