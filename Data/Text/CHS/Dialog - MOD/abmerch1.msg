{100}{}{你看见一个商人。}
{102}{}{你看见这个商人在试着修理这个抽水泵。}
{103}{}{我只是没有某种东西继续工作。}
{104}{}{看上去修起来非常困难。}
{105}{}{这是什么狗屎！}
{106}{}{真是顽固的婊子对吧？}
{107}{}{你能伸手帮个忙吗？}
{108}{}{也行你对这个运气会更好一些。}
{109}{}{嗨，谢谢你修好的抽水泵。}
{110}{}{你应该向修士长通报一下抽水泵现在修好了。}
{200}{}{谢谢帮我们做这个。}


{300}{}{啊，这是什么破玩意――我现在很忙。你有什么需要还是你只是想浪费我的时间？}
{301}{}{实际上是，修士长叫我来的。他说这个抽水泵有一点问题。}
{302}{}{嗯哈，“有一点问题”只是保守说法。这已经完全坏了。已经没法再起动了。}
{303}{}{好吧，介意我查看一下吗？我答应过修士长看看我能做点什么。}
{304}{}{当然，我的客人。你也不可能再把它弄的更糟了。}
{305}{}{我无意打扰，不过看上去有些故障？}
{306}{}{阿比的主抽水泵坏了。最糟的是这样下去再过几天农作物会慢慢死去的。}
{307}{}{我有个工程学学位，介意我看看吗？}
{308}{}{好吧，我对机械不是非常在行，不过或许我能找出问题所在。}
{309}{}{没问题，没人会阻止你。}
{310}{}{噢，对不起，再见。}
{311}{}{我会知道我能做什么了。}

{312}{}{I thought I might be able to help, but if you want to be an asshole about it, then you're welcome to figure it out on your own.}
{313}{}{I told the Abbot I'd be willing to help, but if you want to be an asshole about it, then you're welcome to figure it out on your own.}

{320}{}{[He squints at you for a moment, then slowly lets out his breath in a sigh.] Sorry friend, this thing's being a real bitch, and it's gotten me all worked up. I didn't mean to snap at ya. }
{321}{}{Well, what seems to be the problem then?}
{322}{}{Whatever, bye.}

{330}{}{Come back and talk to me in the morning.}

{400}{}{噢，又是你，一切顺利吗？}
{401}{}{不，还在进行。找到后我会回来的。}
{402}{}{实际上是，我查看了一下看上去是发动机坏了。原因是旧连接器烧了，导致发电机也坏了。找个新的发电机再重新连上电线就行了。}

{500}{}{嗯……主发动机挂了？好吧，我找一些新连接器来就能工作了。不过没有新的发动机。我想地下掩体城会有那玩样。去那找哈利，告诉他戴夫叫你来的。这玩样很贵，不过他会给你折扣的。}
{501}{}{我现在就去那，马上回来。}

{502}{}{Whoa, hold on a second. I was happy to help you figure out the problem, but who said I'm willing to trek across the wastes to go buy you an expensive motor? If you want my help, it's going to cost you.}
{503}{}{How 'bout *you* tell Harry that when you go fetch it your damn self? I'm not your fucking errand boy. Bye.}

{510}{}{Alright, I wouldn't expect someone to do work for free. The part will cost you bout 500 and I think 100 more for your trouble is reasonable. Here's 600.}
{511}{}{That's better. I'll be back with the part.}

{600}{}{一切顺利吗？这机器可不会自己修好。}
{601}{}{正在做呢。我找到就会回来的。}
{602}{}{是的，东西在这。}

{700}{}{太好了，要我装上去还是你愿意效劳？}
{701}{}{我想我能操作它。让开一点。}
{702}{}{实际上，我想我已经做的够多了。你自己装吧。}

{800}{}{很好，交换一下。}
{801}{}{你请吧。}

{900}{}{做这事。}
{901}{}{抽水泵被修好了。}

#if head monk gives you the quest
{910}{}{(擦着额头的汗)是的，需要什么？}
{911}{}{修士长说你需要一些帮助。似乎出了什么问题？}
{912}{}{别介意。再见。}
#already looked at water pump
{913}{}{I took a look at the water pump and it seems the motor is completely busted. The connections are shot, so we're going to have to get our hands on a new motor, as well as some wires to reconnect everything since the old wires are fried.}
