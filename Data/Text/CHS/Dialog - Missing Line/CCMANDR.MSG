{100}{}{你看到一个穿着动力装甲的人。}
{101}{}{你看到一个那瓦罗基地指挥官。}
{102}{}{你看到一个人穿着设计奇怪的动力装甲。在装甲上有一个你没有看过的标志。}

{103}{}{你们这些人是谁――警告！基地有侵入者！}
{104}{}{我没有时间闲谈，你可以走了。}
{105}{}{死吧。}
{106}{}{好。}

{107}{}{我告诉你我没有时间。除了我叫你之外，不要再进来我的办公室，出去！}
{108}{}{不遵守上级的命令就是反叛。我没有时间跟你上军事法庭，所以我会用我自己的方法来处理。卫兵！将这白痴给杀了！}
{109}{}{好。}
{110}{}{去死！}

{111}{}{Fob就在那边的锁柜中。在它安全的放好之后，叫负责的军官与我联络。你可以走了！}
{112}{}{是，长官！}

{113}{}{快一点，我没有很多时间。}
{114}{}{是，长官！}

{115}{}{离开我的锁柜，不然我就会好好的对付你的。}
{116}{}{是，长官！}

{117}{}{基地正在警戒中，我也不认识你。给我看你的证件，士兵。}
{118}{}{证件？}
{119}{}{被你发现了！}
{120}{}{我没有带……}
{121}{}{证件？在这边！}

{122}{}{答错了，败类。你应该随时都要带着证件的。你应该知道的！}
{123}{}{我操你妈。}

{124}{}{离开我的锁柜，不然我就会好好的对付你的。}
{125}{}{去死吧。}

{200}{}{Alright, let's get this over with--I don't like muties stinking up my office, and I got shit to do. Do you work for the Salvatores? }
{201}{}{None of your business, asshole.}
{202}{}{I work for no one.}
{203}{}{So what if I do?}
{204}{}{Yeah, I work for the Salvatores.}
{205}{}{Before I answer any questions, I've got a few of my own.}

# None of your business, asshole
{210}{}{I don't have time for this bullshit. Guards! Kill this mutie!}

#I work for no one
{220}{}{So you're saying you're nothing more than a stray wasteland rat that happened to wander into one of our vertibirds?}
{221}{}{Uh, yeah, pretty much . . . except for that part about me being a rat.}
{222}{}{That's right.}
{223}{}{No, I'm saying that this is all just a big misunderstanding. I don't know who you guys are, and I don't care. So if you don't mind, I'll be moving along now.} 
{230}{}{Good, if you're acting alone, then I don't have to waste another second of my time with you. Guards! Kill this mutie!}

{240}{}{You're not leaving here alive, mutant. I couldn't risk you blabbing the location of this base to all your wasteland friends, now could I? Guards! Kill this mutie!} 
# So what if I do?/ Yeah, I work for the Salvatores.
{250}{}{Tell me what I want to know, and I'll make sure your death is quick and . . . relatively painless. Did Salvatore put you up to this?}
{251}{}{Uhh . . . no? Wait, yeah. Maybe.}
{252}{}{Nope. Playing hide-and-seek in your flying machine was all my own idea. Genius, I know.}
{253}{}{Yeah, he thought he'd sweeten the trade by sending me along. What a deal, huh?}
{254}{}{Before I answer any questions, I've got a few of my own.}

{260}{}{I don't have time for this bullshit. Guards! Kill this mutie!}

{270}{}{That supposed to be funny, mutant? I think you'll be a lot funnier to me when you're a bleeding corpse. Guards! Kill this mutie!}

{280}{}{Oh, you do? [He chuckles.] Well hell, why not? You're dying anyway. What do you want to know, mutant?}
{281}{}{Why do you keep calling me a mutant?}
{282}{}{Who the hell are you guys?}
{283}{}{Where am I? }
{284}{}{How can I get some of that sweet armor?}
{285}{}{I've heard enough.}

{290}{}{Because you ARE. Sure, you might look kinda human, but don't let that fool you. You're still a mutant. You and everyone else on the mainland. All tainted. Next question?}
{300}{}{We're the Enclave--the last bastion of true humanity on this damn planet. We're the only ones still upholding the honor of the ol' red, white, and blue. That's right, we're true patriots. We eat bald eagles and shit stars and stripes. We're all that's left of the great United States of America. But we're enough. Oh, yeah, we're enough to set things right. You can count on that, mutie. Next question?}
{310}{}{This here's Navarro, our secret mainland base. We're sitting right on the coast of California and the pacific ocean. Next question?}
{320}{}{By prying it off my dead body. Good luck with that, mutie. Next question?}
{330}{}{Good, 'cause I'm damn tired of wasting my breath on a mutant. In fact, this whole things a waste of my time, because I don't give a flying fuck what you've got to say to me. Guards! Kill this mutie!}
