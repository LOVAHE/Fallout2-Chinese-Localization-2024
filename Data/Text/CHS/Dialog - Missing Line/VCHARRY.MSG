{100}{}{你看见一个相当矮小，但是看起来却很开心的人。}
{101}{}{你看见商店的老板哈利。}
{102}{}{你好，我可以帮你吗？}
{103}{}{我要想要做买卖。我可以看看你有些什么货物吗？}
{104}{}{你有卖犁吗？}
{105}{}{我买}
{106}{}{没事，谢谢你。}
{107}{}{对不起。我帮不上你的忙。}
{108}{}{当然了，我有卖。$800我就卖给你。}
{109}{}{我出$600。}
{110}{}{成交。我买了。}
{111}{}{$800？让我先去凑钱吧。}
{112}{}{算了。就让史密斯家里挨饿吧。}
{113}{}{给你。[将钱收起来]。你要现在就拿走，还是要我送到那里去？}
{114}{}{送到史密斯家去吧。}
{115}{}{对不起，朋友；但是你得要出$800。}
{119}{}{你要得要将钱拿出来付我才行。}
{120}{}{我去拿钱。}
{121}{}{没问题。我这就送去。}
{122}{}{竟敢偷东西。浑蛋小偷！警卫！警卫！}

{123}{}{Dave sent me. We're trying to fix a broken water pump, and he said you'd have a replacement motor.}
{124}{}{Working with Dave, eh? Yeah, I know the fella. I see he's still got a knack for getting others to do his leg work--lazy bastard. [He chuckles.] Anyway, I think I got what you're lookin for, but lemme just go back an' check. [Harry goes into his back room where you hear boxes being shuffled and moved around. He returns a minute later.] Yep, got it right here. $500 and she's all yours.}
{125}{}{Sure. Here's the money.}
{126}{}{500? Damn. I hope I get reimbursed for this. Fine, here is the money.}
{127}{}{Thanks for the business. Take care.}
{128}{}{Bye.}
{1288}{}{Looks like I don't have enough money. Bye.}

{129}{}{Connar sent me for the goods.}
{130}{}{[Harry's eyes dart around quickly, he seems a bit nervous] Yes, sure. Just a moment...}
{131}{}{[Harry brings you the rifles.] Here, take em. That'll be ten thousand, and let's make this snappy.}
{132}{}{Of course, here's the money.}
{133}{}{But Connar only gave me five grand.}
{134}{}{But Connar only gave me two grand.}
{135}{}{Not my problem. Look, my business struggles enough as it is. If anyone finds out I'm providing Connar with weapons, then things will turn real ugly, real fast. Besides, I'm giving him a discount already.}
{136}{}{Look, I'm putting my neck on the line . . . Oh, to hell with it, I don't have time to argue. Just take em. [He quickly pockets your money.] Now get outta here. And remember, you didn't buy those from me.}
{137}{}{Excellent. But remember, you didn't buy these weapons here.}
{138}{}{It's a deal. Bye.}
{139}{}{[MORE]}
{140}{}{Well then, wait a bit until I get the money.}
{141}{}{Well, have you brought the money?}
{142}{}{What if I just give you five grand?}
{143}{}{What about two grand?}
{144}{}{Ehmmm... ten grand?! I don't have that much money; wait a bit until I get it.}
{145}{}{Damn! Who could possibly have turned me in?!}
{146}{}{Hey! What was I imprisoned for?}
{147}{}{Well, at least the food's not bad.}
{148}{}{What are you staring at?}
{149}{}{What will happen to my shop now?}

{200}{}{$500? Hey, maybe you could give me some kind of discount, I mean, you and Dave are friends, right?}
{201}{}{To tell you the truth, I never really cared for the fella. $500 for the motor. Take it or leave it.}
{202}{}{Fine. Here's the money.}
{203}{}{Forget it, I'm outta here.}
{204}{}{$500!? Forget this, I'm outta here.}
