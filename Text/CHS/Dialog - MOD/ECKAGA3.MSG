{100}{}{你看见一个穿着金属装甲的人。}
{101}{}{你看到卡贾。}
{102}{}{那是不太伟大的卡贾。他穿着金属装甲，想要杀你。}
{103}{}{又是你！}
{104}{}{我对我们不停的见面感到相当烦感。}
{105}{}{获选者，哦。}
{106}{}{让我们作个结束吧。}

{150}{}{[A tall and powerfully built warrior stands before you, his eyes blaze with hatred as he looks you over.] So, they cast out Kaga, then deem YOU the Chosen One? Ha! You think being the grandchild of the Vault Dweller makes you special?! You think you are better than I, Kaga the Great?!}
{151}{}{Well, I AM the Chosen One, aren't I?}
{152}{}{Hey now, hold on a second. I never said I was better than you.}

{160}{}{That title will mean nothing when Kaga rips the head from your shoulders!}
{161}{}{No words can save your hide. With your death, Kaga's honor shall be restored. Kaga will now take his vengeance!}

#dumb dialogue

{202}{}{Me no likie. U lookie bad.}
{203}{}{Kaga won't even bother speaking with you further. Prepare to die at the hands of Kaga!}
